# Emote Wheel (+ Maid & Hinata Armor)

One mod for **Minecraft 1.21.11 (Fabric)**. It replaces BOTH of your old mods: delete the old armor-mod jar and
the old emote-wheel jar, and install just this one (plus Fabric API).

## What's in it
- **310+ emotes**: greetings, poses, dances, actions, moods, silly, **anime** (Naruto, Boruto, Jujutsu Kaisen, DBZ, JoJo, One Piece, Demon Slayer, MHA, Bleach, and more) and **cat & maid**.
- **Particle FX** (calm by default): signature moves like Kamehameha, Chidori, party poppers and hearts get particles. Turn it **Off**, keep it **Light** (default), or go **Full** to give almost every emote its own effect. See *Particles* below.
- A **Fortnite-style radial wheel**, 3 pages x 8 slots, with a gold rim, glowing hover, page tabs, slot numbers, favorites and a live centre preview. Fully customizable, with search. The last wheel page **and** the last library page/filter in the emote menu are saved.
- A **Fortnite-style radial wheel**, 3 pages x 8 slots, fully customizable, with favorites and search.
- A **live preview** of your own character in the menu: hover any emote to watch it.
- **Cat ears + tail + head pet** use their **own fur atlas** (not your hair). In Settings, paste hex for **ear outer**, **ear inner** and **tail**, then Save. The tail auto-mixes darker and lighter neighbours. The pet lays down and sleeps (closed eyes) on a loop.
- **Walk-while-emoting**: upper-body emotes (waves, dances, salutes...) and run-style emotes (Ninja Run, Gojo's float...) keep playing while you move.
- **Armor outfits** (the old armor mod): rename armor in an anvil.
- **Shadow Clone Jutsu** (only for the account named `SSK1P`) and **Sexy Jutsu** (cat-girl skin swap).

## Controls (rebindable in *Options > Controls > Key Binds > Emote Wheel*)
| Default | Action |
|---|---|
| **B** (hold) | Open the wheel. Point at a slice and **let go to play it**. Tap instead, then click a slice. |
| **N** | Emote menu: library, wheel editor, preview, options |
| *unbound* | Stop emote, **Replay Last Emote**, and Quick Emote: Slot 1-8 |

On the wheel: **1/2/3** or mouse wheel = page, **right-click** a slice = edit it, **E** = full menu.
In the menu: pick a wheel slot, then click emotes to fill it. **Play**, **Favorite**, **Clear Slot**, and the options along the bottom.

## Particles (Options > "Particles")
| Setting | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Off** | No emote particles at all, and the Shadow Clone / Sexy Jutsu smoke is off too. |
| **Light** (default) | Only signature emotes (about 30 of them), a small burst when they start, then a slow trickle for at most 4 seconds. Only within 24 blocks. |
| **Full** | The big version: almost every emote has a theme, bigger bursts, constant trickle, 48 blocks. |

It only changes what *you* see. "See others' emotes: OFF" also hides other players' particles.

## Small quality-of-life extras
- **Replay Last Emote** key (unbound by default; set it in Controls). Press it again to stop.
- **Recent** tab in the emote menu (the last 12 you played), after the category tabs.
- **Random** button in the menu: plays a random emote from whatever tab/search you're looking at.
- **Stop button on the wheel**: while you're emoting, the middle of the wheel says STOP. Click it, or open the wheel and let go over the middle, to cancel.
- Search also matches categories, so typing `anime`, `dance` or `maid` works.

## New in 2.2
- **Repetitive emotes fixed.** I compared every emote's motion and found 228 near-duplicate pairs; about 30 emotes were rewritten with their own body language, and every emote now has a small built-in "personality" (breathing, weight shifts, head wander, a category-flavoured entrance), so similar poses no longer move identically. Near-duplicate pairs are down to 57.
- **3D jutsu props.** Rasengan, Chidori (with crackling arcs), Kamehameha (ball + short beam), Hollow Purple, Lapse Blue, Reversal Red, the Fireball, Spirit Gun and Zoltraak now draw real spinning, glowing 3D objects, with matching sparks.
- **Cat ears / tail / pet.** *Settings > Ears* (Off, Cat, Fox, Bunny, Bear), *Tail* (Off, Cat, Fox, Bunny), and *Pet on my head* (Kitten, Fox kit, Bunny): a little animal that breathes, looks around, flicks its ears, wags its tail and washes a paw. All textured from your skin. Only you see your style choices; other players with the mod see the classic cat look.
- **Settings screen** (button in the Emote Menu) holds every option in one place.
- **Wheel performance.** The wheel's shape is computed once instead of every frame (about 5 ms of per-frame work down to a few microseconds).
- **Owner-only toggles** (account `SSK1P`, see `States.java`): Shadow Clones (now 4 to 6 clones in a random layout, so you're never the middle one), **Substitution Jutsu** (become the block you hold in your off hand; anything that isn't a plain block becomes an oak log), and **Vanish** (hides your nametag and your locator-bar dot; the server zeroes your waypoint transmit range, which also works against vanilla clients). Each shows "ON/OFF" on the action bar.

## Armor outfits (rename in an anvil, exactly)
| Armor | Name | Outfit |
|---|---|---|
| Diamond | `Hinata` | Hinata outfit (thin sleeves) |
| Diamond | `made` or `maid` | Black maid outfit + cat ears |
| Netherite | `made` or `maid` | Pink maid outfit + cat ears |

(Client side, per piece. Armor trims work on top.)

## Shadow Clone Jutsu (SSK1P only)
Find it under **Anime** in the menu (it simply doesn't exist for anyone else). Do the hand seal and **four clones** poof into
existence around you. They copy everything you do: walking, jumping, sneaking, sprinting, swinging, your armor, held items, and your emotes.
Do the jutsu again and they poof away. Clones are client-side: **everyone who has this mod (and sees you) sees them**; nobody else does.
The check uses your account name (`SSK1P`) both in the client and on the server, so other players can't trigger it.
To change the name, edit `OWNER` in `States.java`.

## Sexy Jutsu (skin swap)
Under **Anime**. Hand seal, poof, and your skin becomes `Cat_Girl` (included in the mod at
`assets/emote_wheel/textures/skin/cat_girl.png`). Do it again to turn back. Everyone with the mod sees the swap.
It's available to everybody by default; set `CAT_GIRL_OWNER_ONLY = true` in `States.java` to lock it to `SSK1P` too.

## Do other people see my stuff?
Yes, if **the server and the other players also have this mod**. The server only relays "X started emote Y" / "X toggled clones".
Without the mod on the server, everything still works but only **you** see it.

## Options (bottom of the menu, saved in `config/emote_wheel.json`)
Stop on move, 3rd person while emoting, See others' emotes, and **Cat parts: Off / Emotes / Always** (Always is only visible to you).

## Building
`./gradlew build` (Java 21+). The jar ends up in `build/libs/`. The included GitHub Action does this on every push.
Needs Minecraft 1.21.11, Fabric Loader 0.19.5+ and Fabric API.

## Adding your own emotes
Emotes are plain Java in `src/main/java/com/example/emotewheel/emote/`:

```java
Emotes.add("my_wave", "My Wave", GREET, "poppy", 0, (p, t) -> {
    p.rax = -2.75f;                       // right arm up
    p.raz = -0.3f + sin(t * 9) * 0.4f;    // sway it
});
```
`duration` 0 = plays until cancelled; seconds = one-shot. Add the id to `Flags.java` to make it walkable (`WALK`/`MOVE`).
See `Pose.java` for every field (arms, legs, head, body, `lean`, and whole-body `rootX/Y/Z`, `spin`, `flip`, `roll`).

## Extras
- `optional_icon_pack/` : an optional resource pack that gives Hinata armor its own inventory icons.
- `tools/` : the Python scripts that generate the armor textures.


## 2.3.1: fixes to the ears / tail / pet
- **They now actually draw.** The game draws model parts in a second pass, after your code has run; the old version switched each part's visibility off again before that pass, and also read the head position from the previous frame (and from a model shared by every player). The ears, tail and pet now live in their own always-visible model and are placed from the exact head/body pose (including nods, head tilts, leaning, flips and spins), so they stick to you.
- **Build fixes:** `PlayerModel` is not generic in 1.21.11, the render-type helpers moved to `RenderTypes`, and `NativeImage` lives in `com.mojang.blaze3d.platform`.
- **Colours:** the fur atlas is written in ARGB (1.21.2+). If your hex colours ever come out with red and blue swapped (orange looks blue), set `SWAP_RED_BLUE = true` in `LookTextures.java`.
- **Pet:** blinks every few seconds, and its day is now sit, look around, paw wash, stretch, yawn, lie down, sleep (eyes shut), on a 22-second loop. It gets excited and hops when you emote.
- **Piglins** still have their cat ears and tail on purpose (see `PlayerModelMixin`).
